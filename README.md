## Project Overview:

This project is designed to manage and execute four distinct activities, each serving a specific purpose. The activities focus on file handling, object persistence, and user interaction, providing a practical approach to learning Java programming concepts.

---

### **Learning Outcomes**:

Perform input and output operations using language-specific procedures and class libraries.

- Utilize the console for input and output operations.
- Apply formatting to display information.
- Use files to store and retrieve information.
- Create programs that use various methods to access file content.
- Implement object persistence using serialization.

## **Activities**

### **Activity 1: Saving Text to a File**

The purpose of Activity 1 is to interact with the user to collect a text input, validate its length, format it, and save it to a file. This activity focuses on user input validation, text formatting, and file writing.

#### **Demonstrated Concepts**:

- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensuring user input meets specific requirements (minimum length).
- **Text Formatting**:
  - Applying transformations to text (uppercase conversion and replacing spaces).
- **File Writing**:
  - Saving formatted text to a file programmatically.

### **Activity 2: Retrieving Text from a File**

The purpose of Activity 2 is to read the content of a file and display each character along with its ASCII (decimal) value, separated by commas. This activity focuses on file reading and character manipulation.

#### **Demonstrated Concepts**:

- **File Reading**:
  - Accessing and reading the content of a file programmatically.
- **Character Manipulation**:
  - Extracting individual characters from a string and converting them to their ASCII values.
- **Formatting Output**:
  - Displaying information in a structured format for better readability.

### **Activity 3: Merging Content from Multiple Files**

The purpose of Activity 3 is to merge the content of two files into a new file, add a signature message, and save the result. This activity focuses on file manipulation and content merging.

#### **Demonstrated Concepts**:

- **File Manipulation**:
  - Reading content from multiple files and writing to a new file.
- **Content Merging**:
  - Combining data from different sources into a single structured output.
- **Appending Content**:
  - Adding additional information (signature) to the file after merging.

### **Activity 4: Object Persistence and Retrieval**

The purpose of Activity 4 is to implement persistence and retrieval of objects using files. This activity focuses on object serialization, file handling, and user interaction through a menu.

#### **Demonstrated Concepts**:

- **Object Serialization**:
  - Saving and retrieving objects using file serialization.
- **File Handling**:
  - Managing file operations for persistence and retrieval.
- **User Interaction**:
  - Implementing a menu-driven program for user input and output.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - Using classes and methods to encapsulate functionality.

### **Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive approach to learning file handling, object persistence, and user interaction in Java. Each activity builds upon core programming concepts, ensuring practical application and mastery of theoretical knowledge.
